# A study of the main techniques used to perform ordinal regression

In this project we performed some techniques to perform a ordinal regression. This means that the labels that we have to predict are ordered. 
We explored the following three ordinal regression techniques:
* multinomial regression
* parallel ordinal regression
* non parallel ordinal regression

We perform cross validation to test the performances of those models on our dataset.
To evaluate the performances we used:
* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Mean absolute error (MAE)
* Mean zero error (MZE)

## General information

## Team
The team is composed by the following members:
* Sandro Barissi: @sandrobarissi
* Anna Peruso: @annaperu
* Francesco Bollero: @frabolle

## Environment
The project has been developed with `python 3.8`.

The required library are `numpy, scipy, sklearn, statsmodels and pandas`.

The library for vizualisation are `matplotlib and seaborn`.
