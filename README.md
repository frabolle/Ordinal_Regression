Issues 

Should we explore one single methods or many methods? 
Which approach should we follow? Emphasis on dataset? Theory? 
How should we measure the accuracy? 
Shoud we preprocess the data? 

answers
stick to logistic regression
it's only working on some conditions: assumptions are even stronger
w is common to all odds ratio
we would like the directions to be slightly different 

isotonic regression (monotonic regression)
wine dataset : class are imbalanced. Re-weighting of the data.

Evaluation of performance
Confusion matrix
not unique method
count the number of mistakes
